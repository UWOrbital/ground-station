## UW Orbital Docs
The UW Orbital Docs are a great source of codebase documentation. The site includes many detailed setup guides as well as code style guides. **We highly recommend following these guides if you are new to the team or software development in general.**

You will find it most helpful to check out the setup guides, build tutorials, and style guides.

Check out the site here: https://uworbital.github.io/OBC-firmware/

The documentation site now contains most of the information previously found in this README.

## Notion
The team Notion is another important source of information. Here you'll find other team documentation, onboarding info, and links to useful resources.

The software section of the Notion is available here: https://www.notion.so/uworbital/Software-a613c4aaa36449969010cabba2fc329d
